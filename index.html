		 <p>With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as a truly great<br>husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture. Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and<br>beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eams look".</p>
		 <img id="chair1" src="img/chair1.png"/>
		 <p> That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames lounge chair, now in the <br>permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York<br><br>
		 Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project the same way: Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it better?</p></div>

		 <p class="quote"> "Choose your corner; pick away at it carefully, intensely &amp; to the best of<br> your ability, &amp; that way, you might change the world" <br>-Charles Eames</p>
		 <p id="quotep">They loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture, process and product, style and function. "The details are<br> not details", said Charles. "They make the product".</p>

		 <p>Their own concepts evolved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of inspiration", he said, "a kind of 30-year flash". <br><br>
		 A design critic ounce said that this extraordinary couple "just wanted to make the world a better place". That they did. That also made it a lot more <br> interesting.</p>
